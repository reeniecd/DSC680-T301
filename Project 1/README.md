### ARIMA Weather Data Model

This repository contains the code and data used to create an ARIMA weather data model that can predict the average temperature in a specific geographic region for the next three years based on historical data.

### Data Requirements

To create the ARIMA weather data model, you will need the following data:

Historical temperature data for the specific geographic region of interest.
Time series data for other weather variables that may impact temperature, such as humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.
Any relevant external factors that may impact temperature, such as solar radiation or geographical features.
Data for any significant events that may impact temperature, such as natural disasters or human activity.
Data on seasonal trends, such as changes in temperature patterns throughout the year.
A dataset for the dependent variable, which would be the average temperature in your target region.

Please note that having access to accurate and reliable data is essential for creating a robust ARIMA weather data model. Therefore, it's essential to ensure that your data is collected and processed carefully to avoid any biases or errors that could impact the accuracy of your model's predictions.

### Repository Contents
This repository contains the following files:

weather.csv: This file contains the data used to create the ARIMA weather data model.
ARIMA_WEATHER_FORECAST.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the source code used to create the ARIMA weather data model.

### How to Use
To use the ARIMA weather data model, follow these steps:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/reeniecd/DSC680-T301

Ensure that you have all the required data, including the historical temperature data and other relevant weather variables.
Open the ARIMA_WEATHER_FORECAST.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.
Run the notebook cells to load the data, preprocess it if necessary, create the ARIMA model, and generate temperature predictions.
Explore the generated temperature predictions and analyze the model's performance.
