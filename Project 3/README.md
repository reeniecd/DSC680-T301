### Weather Channel
Welcome to Reenie's Weather Channel! This Python program, saved as Temperature.ipynb, is designed to provide real-time weather information for cities in the United States. By making use of the OpenWeather API, the program fetches data and displays comprehensive weather details based on user input.

### Features
The program offers the following features:

Weather by Zipcode: Users can enter a zipcode to retrieve weather information for a specific location.

Weather by City: Users can enter a city name to fetch weather details for the corresponding location.

Termination: Users have the option to terminate the program when they are done accessing weather information.

### Getting Started
To use this program, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the Temperature.ipynb file.

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, such as Python and the necessary libraries (e.g., requests, json).

Sign up for an API key at OpenWeather to access the OpenWeather API.

Open the Temperature.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook or any compatible Python environment.

Replace the placeholder <YOUR_API_KEY> in the program with your actual OpenWeather API key.

Run the program.

### Usage
Once the program is running, you will be prompted to select an option:

Weather by Zipcode: Enter 1 to fetch weather information by providing a zipcode.

Weather by City: Enter 2 to retrieve weather details by entering a city name.

Termination: Enter 3 to terminate the program.

For example, if you choose option 1, you will be asked to enter a zipcode. Next, you will need to select the metric option for temperature (e.g., Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin). The program will then make an API call to OpenWeather using the provided zipcode and display the current weather conditions and forecast for the specified location.

You can also check the weather for another city by entering Y when prompted.

### Note
Make sure you have an active internet connection for the program to retrieve accurate weather data. Additionally, it is essential to provide a valid OpenWeather API key to access the API successfully.

Enjoy using Reenie's Weather Channel and stay informed about current weather conditions!
