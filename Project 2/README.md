### Shoe Classification
This repository contains code for shoe classification using image data. The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from the University of Texas at Austin's Fine-Grained Visual Categorization project. Please note that the dataset is intended for academic use only.

### Dataset
The shoe classification dataset can be obtained from the following source:

UT-Zap50K Dataset (ut-zap50k-images.zip, 291 MB)
After downloading the dataset, extract the contents of the zip file to the following local directory: https://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/finegrained/utzap50k/

### Files
This repository contains the following files:

Shoe_Image_Classification.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for training and evaluating the shoe classification model.
Shoe_Image_Classification_V2.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains an alternative version of the code for training and evaluating the shoe classification model.

### Usage
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

Download and extract the shoe classification dataset from the provided source.
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/reeniecd/DSC680-T301
Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. See the requirements section in the notebook for details.
Open the Shoe_Image_Classification.ipynb or Shoe_Image_Classification_V2.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.
Modify the notebook if needed (e.g., adjusting hyperparameters, changing paths).
Run the notebook cells to train the shoe classification model and evaluate its performance.
Experiment with different configurations and techniques to improve the model's accuracy and performance.
