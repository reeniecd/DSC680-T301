# Movie Recommendation System

The Movie Recommendation System is a program (Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb) that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and provides suitable recommendations. The system utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to generate personalized movie recommendations.

## Features

- User input: Users can enter their preferred movie, and the program will provide suitable recommendations.
- Personalized recommendations: The system generates movie recommendations based on user preferences.
- Data sources: The system uses the following source files:
  - `movies.csv`: Contains movie information such as title, genres, and release year.
  - `tags.csv`: Contains user-generated tags for movies.

## Prerequisites

- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (specified in the notebook file)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/reeniecd/DSC680-T301.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd DSC680-T301/Project 6`

## Data

The system utilizes two data files (`movies.csv` and `tags.csv`) to provide movie recommendations. Ensure that these files are located in the same directory as the notebook file (`Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb`).

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with an online movie database to fetch real-time movie data.
- Implementing different recommendation algorithms (e.g., content-based filtering, hybrid models) for improved accuracy.
- Enhancing the user interface and adding interactive features.
