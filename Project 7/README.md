# LSTM Text Generator

The LSTM Text Generator is a program (LSTM_Text_Generator.ipynb) that uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to generate text based on a given input text. The program utilizes deep learning techniques to learn patterns in the input text and generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

## Features

- LSTM-based text generation: The program uses LSTM neural networks to generate text.
- Customizable input text: Users can provide their own input text to train the model and generate text.
- Training data: The program uses an ebook downloaded from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) as training data. Ensure that you have downloaded and saved a copy of the ebook (e.g., `ebook.txt`) for ease of access.

## Prerequisites

- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (recommended)
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (specified in the notebook file)

## Usage

1. Download the ebook: Visit [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and download an ebook of your choice. Save the ebook as `Aab.txt` in the same directory as the notebook file (`LSTM_Text_Generator.ipynb`).
2. Open the notebook: Open the notebook file `LSTM_Text_Generator.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run the program: Execute the cells in the notebook to train the LSTM model and generate text.

## Note

- The program is computationally intensive and may require a powerful GPU for faster training and text generation. It is recommended to run the program on Google Colab, which provides free access to GPUs.
- You can experiment with different hyperparameters, model architectures, and training data to generate varied and creative text.
