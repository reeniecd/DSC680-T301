### Loan Default Risk Assessment and Customer Segmentation
Welcome to the Loan Default Risk Assessment and Customer Segmentation project! This project aims to develop predictive models to assess the risk of loan default by potential borrowers. Additionally, it involves creating models to segment customers based on demographic and behavioral characteristics. By utilizing these models, lenders can make data-driven decisions, mitigate default risks, and gain valuable insights into their customer base.

#### Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

Loan_Default_Risk_Assessment.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main code for the loan default risk assessment and customer segmentation models. It utilizes the data provided in df2 DataFrame, where X represents the independent columns, and y represents the target variable, loan_type_target.

#### Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the Loan_Default_Risk_Assessment.ipynb file.

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, such as Python and the necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).

Open the Loan_Default_Risk_Assessment.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook or any compatible Python environment.

Run the notebook to execute the code.

#### Project Components
Loan Default Risk Assessment
The loan default risk assessment model uses a set of independent variables (X) including loan amount, term, interest rate, employment length, annual income, debt-to-income ratio, and various other attributes. The target variable (y) is the loan_type_target, indicating whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan.

#### Customer Segmentation
Customer segmentation models are built using a range of demographic and behavioral attributes. These attributes include home ownership, loan purpose, credit grade, delinquency history, and other factors. The segmentation analysis helps lenders gain insights into their customer base, enabling personalized strategies, enhanced customer experience, and targeted marketing campaigns.

#### Note
Please ensure that the provided dataset (df2) is complete and correctly formatted. The independent columns (X) and the target variable (y) should be assigned accordingly for the loan default risk assessment model.
