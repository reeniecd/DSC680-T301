## Predicting House Prices in California
This project aims to predict house prices in California using machine learning techniques. The provided Jupyter Notebook, "Predicting House Prices in California.ipynb", contains the code and analysis for this project.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the California Housing dataset, which provides information on various factors that can influence house prices in California. The dataset includes features such as median income, average number of rooms, average number of bedrooms, population, and more.

### Project Workflow
Data Loading and Exploration: The notebook starts by loading the dataset and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables, identify any missing values, and gain insights into the relationships between variables.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is then preprocessed, including handling missing values, scaling numerical features, encoding categorical variables if applicable, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

Model Selection and Evaluation: Several regression models are implemented and evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The models used in this project include Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression.

Feature Importance Analysis: For the Random Forest Regression model, a feature importance analysis is performed to determine the significance of each feature in predicting house prices. The feature importances are visualized in a bar plot.

Residual Analysis: The residuals (differences between actual and predicted values) are examined to assess the performance and accuracy of the regression models. The residual values are analyzed for distribution, mean, variance, and any patterns or outliers.

Visualization: The project includes visualizations to showcase the actual vs. predicted house values and the residual plot.

### Dependencies
